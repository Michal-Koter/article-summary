"A number of the papers lead on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's attempts to get his Rwanda Bill through Parliament. The proposed legislation would declare Rwanda a safe country and allow the deportation of the UK's asylum seekers there to go ahead. The Daily Telegraph says two of the Conservative Party's deputy chairmen, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith, have said they will rebel over parts of the bill and that they have signed amendments to toughen the legislation. The paper calls it a direct challenge to Mr Sunak's authority and says the pair are effectively challenging the prime minister to sack them from their party posts. It adds that at least five former cabinet members are prepared to vote down the legislation.The Daily Mail and Daily Express both lead on a declaration from Mr Sunak that he will defy Euro judges if they try to block flights to Rwanda. The Mail says it's the first time he's said this publicly and that he wants to end the legal merry-go-round that has prevented flights taking off. The Express says he faces a turbulent 48 hours trying to secure Tory support for his bill.The Times adds that the prime minister is trying to stave off a revolt by promising to secure more judges and court time to speed up legal appeals against deportation that are allowed by the Rwanda Bill. The paper says it's an attempt to assuage concerns that the courts would be so clogged with cases it would render the scheme useless.There's a different angle on the Rwanda row in the i, which reports that 47 asylum seekers who were supposed to be on the first deportation flight to Rwanda are still living in hotels 18 months later. It describes them as having been left in legal limbo. Home Office officials have said there is no binding time limit and the government may seek to remove them for a second time.

"The Daily Mirror says Britain faces what it calls a terror backlash after joining US-led airstrikes on Yemen. It quotes an intelligence expert saying the threat could increase because of the twisted anti-western narrative being put forward by some jihadists.The Daily Express says Rishi Sunak has been urged to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. It has been accused of supporting the Houthis' campaign of piracy in the Red Sea, and attempting assassinations on British soil.The Daily Telegraph says the Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, has warned Iran it must tell the Houthis to cease and desist because the world is running out of patience.The Financial Times leads on the potential ?100m tax bill, and risk of insolvency, for the Post Office. The paper says the auditor PwC has warned that the Post Office may not be able to continue as a going concern, after claiming tax relief on compensation it paid to victims of the IT scandal. One tax expert, quoted by the FT, points to a case won by HM Revenue and Customs against Scottish Power last year, in which it was ruled that compensation payments for mis-selling were not tax-deductible. That expert says the tax office may use the case as evidence that the Post Office must foot the bill.According to the Guardian, Rishi Sunak's Rwanda treaty is unlikely to address the concerns raised by the Supreme Court about the country not being a safe place to send asylum seekers. The paper says legal bodies, academics and human rights groups have all raised concerns in a House of Lords inquiry. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the former immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, says the bill will be a betrayal of the public unless Mr Sunak accepts amendments backed by more than 50 rebel MPs.The Times reports that Michael Gove is lobbying the Treasury to impose a foreign ownership levy on homes in order to deter international investors from buying up residential property in the UK. The paper says the levelling up secretary is understood to be pushing the chancellor to use the Budget to introduce the charge, which could raise up to ?1bn a year. More than 180,000 properties in the UK have foreign domiciled owners - a figure that has more than doubled in the past 12 years. The Times says Mr Gove believes foreign buyers are pushing up prices, and distorting the property market.The Daily Mail details what it calls a deeply moving memo on the late Queen's final moments, written by a senior member of her staff. In the document, which is now in the Royal Archives, the aide describes how she felt no pain and slipped away. The account by Sir Edward Young is contained in a new biography of the King, being serialised by the Mail. It also reveals how, after the Queen's death, royal staff discovered a locked red box containing two letters which she'd written - one to King Charles, the other to Sir Edward himself. The Sun says royal experts believe the existence of the letters shows the late Queen quietly recognised her time on this earth was at an end.

"Post Office fury intensifies, declares the headline on the front of the Sunday Times. It says there is growing pressure on the government for all sub-postmasters wrongly convicted during the Horizon IT scandal to be cleared. The paper says there is particular criticism of the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey. He was the coalition government's postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012. The Sunday Times says he failed to heed warnings about the Horizon system from Alan Bates, the former sub-postmaster who has led the long-running campaign for justice. A spokesman for Sir Ed tells the paper he raised Mr Bates' concerns and says he bitterly regrets that the Post Office was not honest with him. The Sunday Telegraph reports that Rishi Sunak has made his most explicit commitment yet to further tax cuts in the run-up to the general election. In an interview with the paper, he pledges to curb benefits and government spending to fund tax reductions. The paper suggests his intervention hints at a looming income tax cut in the March Budget and says that tax is becoming the primary battle ground between the Conservatives and Labour. According to the Observer, the first findings from the independent Covid inquiry will be published before the summer and it says this could prove an election date headache for the prime minister. The paper claims the report will be explosive and will show how austerity and Brexit hit pandemic planning. The Sunday Express reports that criminal gangs have raked in nearly half a billion pounds getting people across the Channel in small boats. It says more than 114,000 people have made the crossing since 2018, paying an average of ?4,000 each. The figures are based on Labour analysis but the paper says the true amount earned by the gangs could be even higher.

"The Times leads with a warning that elderly people will bear the brunt of strikes at Christmas, with junior doctors in England beginning a new walkout on Wednesday. The paper says Age UK is among groups to have raised fears that hospitals will find it extremely difficult to keep elderly patients safe. The paper highlights the decision by Cheltenham General Hospital to close its emergency department for the duration of the strike, and another planned in the New Year, because of what it calls the scale of disruption.The Daily Telegraph reports that US officials are drawing up plans for military strikes against Houthi sites in Yemen, in response to attacks by the group against Israeli-linked cargo ships in the Red Sea. The Telegraph says the situation has already led to a jump in the price of crude oil, which will be passed on to consumers, while Christmas deliveries from China and other Asian countries are likely to be delayed as ships divert around the Cape of Good Hope.The Guardian says pressure on Israel is rising as the number of deaths in Gaza nears 20,000. The paper says the death toll and the grim conditions for nearly two million people displaced from their homes is fuelling growing international anger, even among Israel's close allies. Israel's military says Hamas is responsible for all civilian casualties, by using Gazans as human shields.The debate around assisted dying, after Dame Esther Rantzen's BBC interview was broadcast on the Today programme on Tuesday morning, is the lead in the Daily Mirror. Her daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, tells the paper she is horrified at the thought of her mother, who has lung cancer, flying to Switzerland to die alone at the Dignitas clinic. The paper says Dame Esther's family back her call for a free vote in parliament on legalising assisted dying. Ms Wilcox says: I don't want her to die. I certainly don't want her to go alone.

"The smiling face of the young Alex Batty, before he went missing six years ago, is pictured on the front of the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People.The People says the seventeen year-old will hold an emotional reunion with his grandmother, who has been waiting for him at her home in Oldham. His aunt, Maureen Batty, tells the Sun on Sunday that he went away as a boy and has come back as a man, and that she just wants to give him a huge hug.The Sunday Times leads with Lord Cameron's call for a sustainable Gaza ceasefire. The paper says this will pile pressure on Israel to end the bloodshed. He has jointly penned his intervention with the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and their article appears in both the Times and the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in Germany.The Times notes the pair do not call for an immediate ceasefire, and in its editorial says the proposal raises more questions than it answers. What is to be done, it asks, if Hamas refuses to come to the table... and wants Israel to be wiped off the map?The Observer says the accidental killing of three hostages in Gaza, by the Israeli military, has been met with incredulity in Israel. The paper adds that this has amplified a sense of anger over the Netanyahu government's handling of the hostage crisis.
