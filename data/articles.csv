A number of the papers lead on Prime Minister Rishi Sunak's attempts to get his Rwanda Bill through Parliament. The proposed legislation would declare Rwanda a safe country and allow the deportation of the UK's asylum seekers there to go ahead. The Daily Telegraph says two of the Conservative Party's deputy chairmen, Lee Anderson and Brendan Clarke-Smith, have said they will rebel over parts of the bill and that they have signed amendments to toughen the legislation. The paper calls it a direct challenge to Mr Sunak's authority and says the pair are effectively challenging the prime minister to sack them from their party posts. It adds that at least five former cabinet members are prepared to vote down the legislation.The Daily Mail and Daily Express both lead on a declaration from Mr Sunak that he will defy Euro judges if they try to block flights to Rwanda. The Mail says it's the first time he's said this publicly and that he wants to end the legal merry-go-round that has prevented flights taking off. The Express says he faces a turbulent 48 hours trying to secure Tory support for his bill.The Times adds that the prime minister is trying to stave off a revolt by promising to secure more judges and court time to speed up legal appeals against deportation that are allowed by the Rwanda Bill. The paper says it's an attempt to assuage concerns that the courts would be so clogged with cases it would render the scheme useless.There's a different angle on the Rwanda row in the i, which reports that 47 asylum seekers who were supposed to be on the first deportation flight to Rwanda are still living in hotels 18 months later. It describes them as having been left in legal limbo. Home Office officials have said there is no binding time limit and the government may seek to remove them for a second time.
The Daily Mirror says Britain faces what it calls a terror backlash after joining US-led airstrikes on Yemen. It quotes an intelligence expert saying the threat could increase because of the twisted anti-western narrative being put forward by some jihadists.The Daily Express says Rishi Sunak has been urged to proscribe Iran's Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps as a terrorist organisation. It has been accused of supporting the Houthis' campaign of piracy in the Red Sea, and attempting assassinations on British soil.The Daily Telegraph says the Defence Secretary, Grant Shapps, has warned Iran it must tell the Houthis to cease and desist because the world is running out of patience.The Financial Times leads on the potential ?100m tax bill, and risk of insolvency, for the Post Office. The paper says the auditor PwC has warned that the Post Office may not be able to continue as a going concern, after claiming tax relief on compensation it paid to victims of the IT scandal. One tax expert, quoted by the FT, points to a case won by HM Revenue and Customs against Scottish Power last year, in which it was ruled that compensation payments for mis-selling were not tax-deductible. That expert says the tax office may use the case as evidence that the Post Office must foot the bill.According to the Guardian, Rishi Sunak's Rwanda treaty is unlikely to address the concerns raised by the Supreme Court about the country not being a safe place to send asylum seekers. The paper says legal bodies, academics and human rights groups have all raised concerns in a House of Lords inquiry. Writing in the Daily Telegraph, the former immigration minister, Robert Jenrick, says the bill will be a betrayal of the public unless Mr Sunak accepts amendments backed by more than 50 rebel MPs.The Times reports that Michael Gove is lobbying the Treasury to impose a foreign ownership levy on homes in order to deter international investors from buying up residential property in the UK. The paper says the levelling up secretary is understood to be pushing the chancellor to use the Budget to introduce the charge, which could raise up to ?1bn a year. More than 180,000 properties in the UK have foreign domiciled owners - a figure that has more than doubled in the past 12 years. The Times says Mr Gove believes foreign buyers are pushing up prices, and distorting the property market.The Daily Mail details what it calls a deeply moving memo on the late Queen's final moments, written by a senior member of her staff. In the document, which is now in the Royal Archives, the aide describes how she felt no pain and slipped away. The account by Sir Edward Young is contained in a new biography of the King, being serialised by the Mail. It also reveals how, after the Queen's death, royal staff discovered a locked red box containing two letters which she'd written - one to King Charles, the other to Sir Edward himself. The Sun says royal experts believe the existence of the letters shows the late Queen quietly recognised her time on this earth was at an end.
Post Office fury intensifies, declares the headline on the front of the Sunday Times. It says there is growing pressure on the government for all sub-postmasters wrongly convicted during the Horizon IT scandal to be cleared. The paper says there is particular criticism of the Liberal Democrat leader, Sir Ed Davey. He was the coalition government's postal affairs minister between 2010 and 2012. The Sunday Times says he failed to heed warnings about the Horizon system from Alan Bates, the former sub-postmaster who has led the long-running campaign for justice. A spokesman for Sir Ed tells the paper he raised Mr Bates' concerns and says he bitterly regrets that the Post Office was not honest with him. The Sunday Telegraph reports that Rishi Sunak has made his most explicit commitment yet to further tax cuts in the run-up to the general election. In an interview with the paper, he pledges to curb benefits and government spending to fund tax reductions. The paper suggests his intervention hints at a looming income tax cut in the March Budget and says that tax is becoming the primary battle ground between the Conservatives and Labour. According to the Observer, the first findings from the independent Covid inquiry will be published before the summer and it says this could prove an election date headache for the prime minister. The paper claims the report will be explosive and will show how austerity and Brexit hit pandemic planning. The Sunday Express reports that criminal gangs have raked in nearly half a billion pounds getting people across the Channel in small boats. It says more than 114,000 people have made the crossing since 2018, paying an average of ?4,000 each. The figures are based on Labour analysis but the paper says the true amount earned by the gangs could be even higher.
Many of Boxing Day's front pages feature images of members of the Royal Family after they attended the Christmas Day church service in Sandringham alongside the King and Queen.The Sun's lead focuses on Sarah, Duchess of York being publicly back at the heart of the royal family as she waved to fans in Norfolk. She appeared alongside her ex-husband Prince Andrew, having not accompanied the family on a walk to the church service for more than three decades.Keeping with the Royal Family theme, the Daily Mirror focuses on King Charles delivering his second Christmas speech, in which the monarch praised the UK as a caring and compassionate country and reminded us to care for the Earth.The Daily Mail also notes King Charles's message as he hails Brits who dedicate themselves to service - he also urged for peace in the ongoing conflicts in the Middle East between Israel and Hamas, as well as the war in Ukraine.
The Times leads with a warning that elderly people will bear the brunt of strikes at Christmas, with junior doctors in England beginning a new walkout on Wednesday. The paper says Age UK is among groups to have raised fears that hospitals will find it extremely difficult to keep elderly patients safe. The paper highlights the decision by Cheltenham General Hospital to close its emergency department for the duration of the strike, and another planned in the New Year, because of what it calls the scale of disruption.The Daily Telegraph reports that US officials are drawing up plans for military strikes against Houthi sites in Yemen, in response to attacks by the group against Israeli-linked cargo ships in the Red Sea. The Telegraph says the situation has already led to a jump in the price of crude oil, which will be passed on to consumers, while Christmas deliveries from China and other Asian countries are likely to be delayed as ships divert around the Cape of Good Hope.The Guardian says pressure on Israel is rising as the number of deaths in Gaza nears 20,000. The paper says the death toll and the grim conditions for nearly two million people displaced from their homes is fuelling growing international anger, even among Israel's close allies. Israel's military says Hamas is responsible for all civilian casualties, by using Gazans as human shields.The debate around assisted dying, after Dame Esther Rantzen's BBC interview was broadcast on the Today programme on Tuesday morning, is the lead in the Daily Mirror. Her daughter, Rebecca Wilcox, tells the paper she is horrified at the thought of her mother, who has lung cancer, flying to Switzerland to die alone at the Dignitas clinic. The paper says Dame Esther's family back her call for a free vote in parliament on legalising assisted dying. Ms Wilcox says: I don't want her to die. I certainly don't want her to go alone.
The smiling face of the young Alex Batty, before he went missing six years ago, is pictured on the front of the Sunday Mirror and the Sunday People.The People says the seventeen year-old will hold an emotional reunion with his grandmother, who has been waiting for him at her home in Oldham. His aunt, Maureen Batty, tells the Sun on Sunday that he went away as a boy and has come back as a man, and that she just wants to give him a huge hug.The Sunday Times leads with Lord Cameron's call for a sustainable Gaza ceasefire. The paper says this will pile pressure on Israel to end the bloodshed. He has jointly penned his intervention with the German foreign minister, Annalena Baerbock, and their article appears in both the Times and the Welt am Sonntag newspaper in Germany.The Times notes the pair do not call for an immediate ceasefire, and in its editorial says the proposal raises more questions than it answers. What is to be done, it asks, if Hamas refuses to come to the table... and wants Israel to be wiped off the map?The Observer says the accidental killing of three hostages in Gaza, by the Israeli military, has been met with incredulity in Israel. The paper adds that this has amplified a sense of anger over the Netanyahu government's handling of the hostage crisis.
The Guardian says Rishi Sunak is facing the biggest week of his premiership, with his authority in the hands of warring tribes on the right and left of the Conservative party - not to mention a gruelling appearance before the Covid inquiry.The Daily Telegraph reports that lawyers commissioned by MPs on the right of the party will demand the prime minister toughen his Rwanda bill - with a block on interventions by judges in Strasbourg - and further curbs on the rights of migrants to appeal against removal to Rwanda.Otherwise, the paper says, Mr Sunak faces his flagship bill being killed off in a Commons revolt. Rishi on the rack is the Metro's headline.The Conservative party chairman Richard Holden, writing in the Express, argues that the legislation puts Rishi Sunak on the side of the British people.The Times says it ha seen a leaked Home Office memo, which predicts that 99.5% of legal cases by migrants will fail to block their deportation to Rwanda.They would then be flown to Kigali having spent less than three weeks in the UK, according to the document. The Times says the details will be circulated among MPs today as part of a whipping operation before Tuesday's vote.Meanwhile, the Daily Mirror leads on comments by Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer who says the Tories' ability to govern has collapsed.Put a sock in it, Lineker! is the headline on the front of the Daily Mail, as it reports on the Match of the Day presenter signing an open letter, calling for the government's Rwanda policy to the scrapped.The Mail says that Gary Lineker's highly political tone is a brazen challenge to the authority of his BBC paymasters - which could be in breach of the corporation's guidelines for its flagship presenters.
Sunak sees off the Tory Rwanda rebels... for now is the Daily Mail's front page headline. It says the prime minister has been warned that he could face a debilitating rebellion in the New Year.For Tthe Sun the draft legislation scraped through. The Times says it's not over yet while Tthe Guardian believes the prime minister now faces weeks of chaos as he struggles to hold together his mutinous party. The Daily Mirror is even more blunt: Nightmare After Christmas is its headline.The Financial Times describes the vote as a significant victory for Rishi Sunak but says it was secured only after a day of frenetic arm-twisting. Downing Street was left jubilant says Tthe Daily Telegraph after days of dark warnings from both sides of the party. It observes that the prime minister hugged his chief whip, Simon Hart, on the floor of the Commons - just moments after the victory. Rishi saves his bacon is how Tthe Metro sums up the story. The prime minister launched a charm offensive, it reports, and won over rebels with bacon butties.The Times reports that ministers are set to announce reforms which will mean local councils are no longer forced to set aside greenfield land for housing needs. The paper says the change is designed to appease rebel Conservative MPs who have warned that opposition to housebuilding in their constituencies will cost them their seats at the general election. Ministers argue that the changes will allow more homes to be built in the long run because councils will be incentivised to produce realistic plans. Industry sources tell the Times the change would be disastrous.
A broad variety of stories feature on the front of Sunday's papers - many include the latest on the situation in the Middle East as 39 Palestinian prisoners were released on Saturday night in exchange for 13 Israeli hostages and four Thai nationals.The Sunday Times carries an interview with relatives of one of the Israelis set free on Friday. Mayan Moshe describes how her 72-year-old aunt Adina thought she was being led away to be executed when she was taken out of the Hamas tunnels she had been kept in for seven weeks. Ms Moshe realised she was being freed only when she saw the Red Cross buses.Irish-Israeli nine-year-old Emily Hand is the focus on the front of the Sunday Mirror after her release on Saturday night. Her father Thomas Hand vowed Emily will have the best Christmas and Hanukah ever.The Sunday Telegraph says emotional scenes have been playing out in Israeli hospitals and medical centres as families were and continue to be reunited after the hostages' release.Separately, the paper reports the head of the charity regulator has promised to clamp down on bodies that host antisemitic extremists - after reports of antisemitic sermons from some mosques linked to charities.Continuing with domestic news Stop small boats or we're sunk, is the Sunday Express headline. It says Conservative MPs have told Rishi Sunak unless the small boats in the English Channel are stopped by the next general election the party faces catastrophe at the polls. One MP said eight out of ten voters he spoke to demanded to know what was being done.
Most of the front pages focus on Rishi Sunak's plan to revive the government's Rwanda policy, after the Supreme Court ruled the scheme was unlawful. PM fights back declares the Daily Express, which describes him as defiant. The Times says Mr Sunak has pledged to do whatever is necessary to get flights to Rwanda off the ground by the next election. The Guardian says Mr Sunak has staked his political credibility on pushing through emergency legislation to resurrect the policy. But The Independent's headline calls him rattled.The Daily Telegraph reports that Conservative rebels have warned that Mr Sunak's proposed new emergency law to declare Rwanda safe doesn't go far enough, and could still be obstructed by the European Court of Human Rights. The Times argues that Mr Sunak is right to, as the paper puts it, exhaust every last judicial avenue in pursuit of a solution to the small boats crisis. But it warns that he's now at risk of breaking his contract with an electorate anxious to see migration controlled and urges ministers to prioritise action, not rhetoric. The Sun's editorial says it cautiously welcomes the government's new approach to get those flights off the ground but says the paper and its readers are sick of broken promises. The Daily Mail suggests Mr Sunak's reaction to the Supreme Court judgement has revealed a new aspect of his personality.More than 50 Labour MPs defying Sir Keir Starmer on last night's vote for a ceasefire in the Israel-Hamas conflict, is reflected in most of the papers. The Telegraph says Sir Keir suffered the biggest rebellion of his leadership so far. The headline in the Daily Express is Starmer's revolt. The Times says Sir Keir was unrepentant as the Gaza vote split his party. Writing in the i, Jane Merrick says the rebellion is not going to cause irreparable damage to the Labour leader, but she argues he has suffered a serious challenge to his authority.Photographs of Elizabeth Debicki as Diana, Princess of Wales, in the latest series of The Crown feature in many of the papers. The first instalment of the final season arrives on Netflix today, covering the princess' death. The Guardian says the entire cast provide brilliant performances but they cannot lift what it calls crass writing. The paper also says the series is impossibly hamstrung by being set well within living memory. In its review, the Daily Mirror says that, despite some flaws with these latest episodes, Netflix's jewel in the crown continues to sparkle.
What might be in Chancellor Jeremy Hunt's Autumn Statement this week features in several of Sunday's papers.The Sunday Times reports that Mr Hunt is mulling over last-minute cuts to income tax or national insurance to help millions of low and middle earners.The paper says Mr Hunt hopes Wednesday's Autumn Statement will boost economic growth - and the Conservative Party's electoral fortunes.The Observer says he could face a revolt by Tory MPs in red wall seats if he presses ahead with a major reduction in inheritance tax - and delivers what it calls a budget for the rich, rather than help for ordinary families.The Sunday Telegraph says Rishi Sunak is planning to station Home Office officials in Rwanda - ahead of a new treaty with the country which is expected to be unveiled this week. Echoing the warnings of some Conservative MPs, the paper says the prime minister risks facing an election catastrophe if he fails to deliver on his small boats policy.In an interview with the Mail on Sunday - her first since she was sacked as home secretary - Suella Braverman criticises Mr Sunak's handling of the Rwanda policy and his approach to antisemitic chants at protests in recent weeks; on the latter issue, she says he lacked moral leadership.
Saturday's papers cover the build-up to the pro-Palestinian march in London and the ongoing row about Suella Braverman's criticism of police.The Mirror says the Metropolitan Police's job has been made harder by the home secretary. It leads with a picture of officers standing guard at the Cenotaph and the headline: Torn apart. It claims Mrs Braverman won't be vindicated if events turn sour, she will be one of the causes of it. Under the headline Cruella clings on, it says her job is already hanging by a thread, after her unauthorised criticism of the police.Sources tell The Times the prime minister's patience with her has run out - and the i agrees, reporting that Rishi Sunak has made the decision to fire the home secretary. It says Conservative whips are preparing for a wide-ranging reshuffle in the coming weeks, which could also see the environment secretary Therese Coffey lose her job. But The Sun puts the odds of a reshuffle at 50-50.The Guardian says Mr Sunak is facing a Tory civil war over Mrs Braverman's future. The paper reports that a number of Conservative MPs are furious with her, while more than 50 others are fighting to help her keep her job. The Mail says at least two have threatened to resign if she's sacked.In The Sun, the headline is: It's come to this. In its leader column, The Daily Telegraph says the march organisers have refused to see reason, while The Daily Mail describes the protest as provocative and deeply offensive, saying it mocks our day of solemnity. The Times says it's misguided and mistimed, but adds that Scotland Yard must police it, not suppress it.
Several of Tuesday's papers lead on the news that almost 300,000 women at risk of breast cancer are to be offered a drug that trials have shown could help prevent the disease.Writing in the Daily Telegraph, Amanda Pritchard, chief executive of NHS England, said it marked a new era for cancer prevention. There's a similar sentiment from the National Clinical Director for Cancer, Professor Peter Johnson, who in a comment piece for the Daily Express calls the announcement genuinely great news. The Times says the drug, Anastrozole, costs 4p a day and will save the NHS around ?15 million in treatment costs.The i says Tuesday's King's Speech setting out the government's agenda for the coming year will see the monarch forced to announce a shredding of eco policy. The paper says the King, who has long campaigned on climate and environmental issues, will have to hide his true feelings as he heralds a new era of oil and gas exploration. The Times says new legislation for driverless vehicles will clear the way for buses, grocery deliveries and farm machinery to operate autonomously by the end of the decade.The Guardian leads on a warning from the United Nations about the overcrowding in shelters in Gaza. A UN official at a compound in the southern city of Khan Younis has told the paper there is one toilet for up to 800 people and no room to sleep. The official says that everyone is just concentrating on survival.A 78-year-old poppy seller who was caught up in a pro-Palestinian rally in Edinburgh has told the Daily Mail he was punched and kicked by protesters. Jim Henderson, who served with the Army in Northern Ireland, said he was set upon while manning a stall at Waverley station on Saturday.
DAVOS, Switzerland � For the last few years at the World Economic Forum cryptocurrency firms dominated the main strip in Davos, promoting their wares.But in 2024, artificial intelligence has taken over. Some of the world�s biggest companies are pushing their AI products and services with one declaring: �The future is AI.�This shift underscores the rapid rise in AI investments and interest last year, sparked by the explosion of popularity of ChatGPT, the AI chatbot developed by OpenAI, and launched at the end of 2022.Global technology companies are jostling to take a lead position in AI and are they are likely hoping their big statements on the Davos Promenade will serve to show their prowess in the field.Companies from U.S. semiconductor firm Intel to Salesforce had AI slogans on the properties they took over. And then there was the �AI House�, an events space hosted by companies including Swiss telecommunications firm Swisscom.AI dominated the Promenade far more than crypto firms, reversing a trend from the past few years.For example, at the World Economic Forum in January 2022, even after the price of cryptocurrencies had collapsed, firms were touting �Bitcoin Pizza Day� and so-called non-fungible tokens. In January 2023, as the crypto winter had set in, firms pulled back on splashing the cash at Davos, but there was still a heavy presence from the industry, inclduing a mysterious orange bitcoin car.
COLUMBUS, Ohio � Several transgender candidates for state office in Ohio are facing challenges and even outright disqualification for omitting their former names from petition paperwork under a little-known state elections law, confronting a unique dilemma as they vie for office in increasing numbers in the face of anti-LBGTQ legislation.Three of the four transgender candidates hoping to win Democratic seats in the Republican-dominated Ohio House and Senate have either been challenged or disqualified for not putting their former name � also called a deadname � on circulating petitions to get on the ballot. But state law mandates that candidates list any name changes in the last five years, though it isn�t in the Secretary of State�s 33-page candidate requirement guide.Additionally, the petition paperwork does not have a place to list any former names and exempts name changes due to marriage.Bobbie Arnold, a contractor from West Alexandria who had been certified, has her disqualification hearing before the Montgomery County Board of Elections Tuesday. Arienne Childrey, a previously certified candidate from Auglaize County hoping to run against Rep. Angie King, a Republican sponsoring anti-LGBTQ legislation, has her own disqualification hearing Thursday.Michigan has a similar elections law, which mandates candidates list any name changes in the past decade, but it�s not clear which others states have one. The Associated Press reached out to several election experts and organizations tracking elections laws, and none were aware of how many states require candidates to disclose name changes.The Ohio law has existed in some form since as early as the 1920s, and the current version has been in place since the 1990s. It�s rarely been enforced in Ohio over the decades, usually in response to candidates wishing to use a nickname on the ballot.The latest case involving a legal name change was resolved in 2023 by the Ohio Supreme Court, in which a mayoral candidate sued the Washington County Board of Elections for disqualifying him because he did not disclose his former name on his petition paperwork. The state�s highest court ruled in favor of the board.Vanessa Joy, a real estate photographer from Stark County, was the first of the candidates to be disqualified for omitting her deadname, despite being certified. She appealed her disqualification but was denied.
A federal judge blocked JetBlue Airways� purchase of budget rival Spirit Airlines, a major win for Biden�s Justice Department, which sued to stop the merger, alleging it would drive up fares for some of the most price-sensitive consumers.JetBlue�s proposed $3.8 billion purchase of discounter Spirit would have produced the country�s fifth-largest airline, a deal the carriers said would help them better grow and compete against larger rivals like Delta and United.The decision, handed down Tuesday by a federal judge in Boston, marks a victory for a Justice Department that has aggressively sought to block deals it views as anticompetitive.�JetBlue�s plan would eliminate the unique competition that Spirit provides�and about half of all ultra-low-cost airline seats in the industry�and leave tens of millions of travelers to face higher fares and fewer options,� the Justice Department alleged in its lawsuit in March.Spirit shares plunged after the decision was announced and were down 60% shortly after 1 p.m. ET. JetBlue shares were down about 5% after briefly spiking.Neither airline immediately commented on the decision.
Jimmy Donaldson, the YouTuber known as MrBeast, is used to evaluating the value of different products in his videos. Now, he's putting another comparison to the test: X vs. YouTube.Donaldson uploaded his first video directly to X on Monday, a reupload of his YouTube video $1 vs $100,000,000 Car! which he initially posted in September. The YouTube upload of this video has received over 211 million views.I�m curious how much ad revenue a video on X would make so I�m reuploading this to test it. Will share ad rev next week, the creator said in an X post.The video had over 52 million views on X as of Tuesday morning.Elon Musk has been trying to court creators and media personalities as X has moved toward becoming a video-first platform. X said in a Jan. 9 blog post it would continue to invest in creators, content partnerships and original content in 2024.X announced last week that it would launch three new shows hosted by former CNN anchor Don Lemon, former U.S. Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and sports radio commentator Jim Rome.Convincing Donaldson to shift from YouTube to X would be a major coup for Musk's company. As MrBeast, Donaldson has emerged in recent years as one of the internet's most popular and profitable personalities thanks in large part to his YouTube account that now counts more than 231 million subscribers.
TAIPEI, Taiwan � A delegation of former U.S. officials met with Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen and her newly elected successor in Taipei on Monday, two days after the self-ruling democracy voted to keep their party in power in a rebuke to Beijing.The unofficial delegation visited as Taiwan, an island 100 miles off China that Beijing claims as its territory, lost one of its few remaining diplomatic relationships, with the Pacific island nation of Nauru announcing it would switch ties to China.A Taiwan official described the move as a �blatant challenge� to democracy by Beijing, which says Taiwan should not have its own president and has criticized the dozens of countries congratulating the island on its successful election.In the presidential election Saturday, Taiwan voters elected Lai Ching-te, Tsai�s vice president, whom China had described as a separatist and a �troublemaker� and warned voters against supporting.Lai, 64, won with 40% of the vote in a three-way race dominated by economic issues but in which his rivals argued for closer ties with Beijing. Though his liberal Democratic Progressive Party won an unprecedented third consecutive term in power, it lost control of the legislature, which experts say could constrain Lai�s policy options when he takes office on May 20.Lai�s victory, and China�s response to it, could test recent efforts by Beijing and Washington to repair relations, which in recent years have fallen to their lowest point in decades. The status of Taiwan is among the most sensitive issues between China, which has not ruled out the use of force in achieving unification, and the U.S., the island�s most important international backer.The bipartisan U.S. delegation, which arrived in Taipei on Sunday, includes Stephen J. Hadley, who was national security adviser under President George W. Bush, and James B. Steinberg, who was deputy secretary of state under President Barack Obama. It is led by Laura Rosenberger, the chair of the American Institute in Taiwan, Washington�s unofficial embassy on the island of 23 million people.Meeting with Tsai in the presidential office, Hadley congratulated her on the success of Taiwan�s election and said the U.S. commitment to Taiwan was �rock solid.�
She made her name as the captain of a ship that rescued stranded migrants from the Mediterranean. But now Carola Rackete is embarking on a new journey, focusing her activist sights on helping to save a crisis-ridden part of the German left.The 35-year-old engineer is to lead the beleaguered Die Linke party into the European parliamentary elections in June as its top candidate.�I feel I have little choice than to get involved in politics. The time is right,� she told the Guardian in an interview. �This is a moment that should politicise us all, if we�re not already politicised.�Do we want those in favour of human rights and climate justice to be in the majority, or will we leave things to the rightwingers and the fascists � it�s quite a simple question we face.�Die Linke, a far-left party that emerged in 2007 from the former East German Communist SED, has recently faced disaster. Sahra Wagenknecht, its most prominent member and former parliamentary group leader, quit weeks ago to form her own new party which launched this month. She has taken nine of Die Linke�s MPs with her and threatening its implosion.The move follows years of tension between Wagenknecht and party leaders who have balked at her attempts to combine leftwing ideas, such as a wealth tax, with a rightwing nationalist-driven rejection of irregular immigration.Wagenknecht has positioned herself as a valid alternative for German voters disillusioned by mainstream politics who might otherwise � as many tens of thousands of Die Linke supporters have done in recent years � shift their allegiance to the far-right AfD.But Rackete � who is, as requested by the party, remaining independent (�it gives more leverage to reach a different audience�) � rejects the idea that she is joining a sinking ship.�When they approached me it was quite clear the party would split. I see this as an opportunity to set it on a new, clear course, attract new members, ditch the nationalist rhetoric for good and turn it into a solid place of organisation for the progressive left,� she said. �I like the image of the phoenix rising from the ashes.�
It was all planned out,� says Adam Johnson. �I knew exactly what I was going to do.� In early 2007, Johnson, then 22, had just finished his degree at the University of Wolverhampton, and was looking forward to a career in glass-blowing.He had moved into his family home in Seaford in East Sussex with a friend and her one-year-old. He had a job at a bar, with flexible hours to allow for his art and the shows he had lined up. And though he was not yet out to his family, he had a boyfriend, whom he�d been seeing for a few months.�I was feeling really positive about the future,� Johnson says. He dreamed of becoming a successful artist, his work on display at top galleries. �In my head, it was always going to happen. And then it wasn�t.�One night in January, Johnson and his boyfriend went out on the town. But the drinking led to arguing and they ended up breaking up on the street. Johnson � drunk, but not blind drunk � went to cross the street for home.The car hit him at 55mph. Johnson smashed into the bonnet, then spiralled over to crash on to the bitumen behind. �I was just like a sack of jelly in the air,� he says.The driver, in shock, carried on home, leaving Johnson splayed on the road. (He later returned and took responsibility, meaning that the crash was legally classed as a �failure to stop�, not a hit and run.) The driver of the truck behind saw the collision, stopped and called an ambulance.Johnson had been wearing his motorcycling gear � jeans, a leather jacket and heavy boots. Doctors later credited it with his survival. As it was, every part of him not covered by leather or denim was �totally annihilated�.In A&E, Johnson was found to have broken both his legs, his nose and all his front teeth, and was put into a coma to help with his recovery. But his physical injuries proved to be just the tip of his trauma.Sixteen years later, we�re sitting in the pastel pink-and-green front room of the Brighton home Johnson shares with his husband, Dan, a graphic designer, and their pug, Egg. Propped against the wall, within reaching distance, are Johnson�s lime-green crutches. Every available surface is crowded with mementoes and tchotchkes, many of them Johnson�s own creations. On the windowsill to our right are two small balls of clay, awaiting transformation; to our left, there�s a vintage �ON AIR� sign, a nod to Johnson�s turn on The Great Pottery Throw Down in 2021.
Perhaps the story should have ended in Budapest. There had been speculation leading up to the Europa League final last May that it could be Jos� Mourinho�s final week in charge of Roma. There were echoes of his previous time working for an Italian club, in 2010, when he led Internazionale to the treble in his second season then left to join Real Madrid immediately after winning the Champions League.He had not touched quite those same heights at Roma, but this was a different context. By claiming the inaugural Europa Conference League in his first season at the club Mourinho had already ended a 14?year wait for silverware. To follow up in season two by lifting the Europa League would have been an extraordinary achievement with a side whose previous biggest continental success was winning the 1961 Inter-City Fairs Cup.But it was not to be. In the final last spring, Roma led through Paulo Dybala but conceded an own goal and ultimately lost a shootout against Sevilla. Both the game and its aftermath were ugly, marked by relentless protests of refereeing decisions which culminated with Mourinho calling Anthony Taylor a �fucking disgrace� in the car park. A day later, the official had a chair thrown at him by Roma fans at the airport.Yet there was another post?game act that got as much attention back in Rome: Mourinho pointing to the ground as he looked to supporters in the stands, letting them know he intended to stay. To say they loved him would be an understatement. Mourinho has been the key factor in Roma selling out more than 40 home games over the past two and a half seasons, including a 36-game consecutive run.When news broke of his sacking on Tuesday morning, fans rushed to the club�s Trigoria training complex for a teary farewell. To understand why he has been so adored might require an awareness of the football culture in Rome, a city that has long perceived itself as an underdog battling the wealth and political influence of clubs in the north.
Carlos Alcaraz began his pursuit of a first Australian Open title with a solid performance as he defeated Richard Gasquet 7-6 (5), 6-1, 6-2 to reach the second round in Melbourne.Alcaraz had opted not to contest a warm-up tournament, meaning the victory is his first official match since his loss to Novak Djokovic in the semi-final of the ATP Finals last year. It is also the Spaniard�s first match at the Australian Open since 2022, when he was ranked outside the Top 30 and lost in the third round, as he was forced to withdraw from last year�s event with injury.As he tried to shake off the rust in his first match of the season, Alcaraz was understandably cautious in the opening set against the 37-year-old Gasquet who backed up strong serving with consistent aggression. In the decisive moments of the first set tie-break, though, Alcaraz took control and never looked back.�Today I felt really well playing here,� said Alcaraz. �Just trying to be better. I think in the first set I struggled a little bit. Richard was playing well as well, but every set I�ve been playing better and better. At the end I think I played at quite a good level.�Since his remarkable performance to defeat Djokovic and win his first Wimbledon title last year, Alcaraz�s form has cooled. The 20-year-old seemed to struggle with the length of the season and he looked fatigued in the final months of the year. He can sometimes play too impulsively and lack discipline in his shotmaking, a quality that will likely improve with greater experience. Still, Alcaraz remains Djokovic�s top contender here and he will face Lorenzo Sonego of Italy in the second round.Meanwhile, Holger Rune, the eighth seed, overcame a tight battle against Yoshihito Nishioka, advancing to the second round with a tough 6-2, 4-6, 7-6 (3), 6-4. The 11th seed, Casper Ruud, had no such problems, dismantling Albert Ramos-Vi?olas 6-1, 6-3, 6-1.For Gasquet, one of the constant figures in men�s tennis over the past two decades and the owner of one of the most iconic backhands in the 21st century, this could well be his last appearance in Australia. The first set demonstrated he is still capable of playing great tennis but he is now ranked No 131, a ranking that will get him into very few top level events. Gasquet has said that he is uninterested in dropping down into the lower ATP events and trying to rebuild his ranking at his age, meaning the end could well be near.
Iga Swiatek and Elena Rybakina began the first grand slam tournament of the year with two of the most difficult first-round opponents possible, yet by stepping up to the challenge both matches only served to reinforce their credentials as two of the favourites.While Swiatek began her brutal path towards a potential Australian Open title by defeating Sofia Kenin, the 2020 champion, 7-6 (2), 6-2, Rybakina edged out Karolina Pliskova 7-6 (6), 6-4 to reach the second round.The last time Swiatek and Kenin stared each other down on-court, Swiatek was playing her first grand slam final at the 2020 French Open while Kenin, the Australian Open champion that year, would be named the WTA player of the year by virtue of her two major finals that season.How things have changed. Over the past two years Kenin has fallen out of the top 400 and then returned to the top 40. With low expectations and pressure all on the shoulders of the No 1, Kenin burst into the match striking the ball beautifully and offering a reminder of her own credentials. Kenin took the ball early, she hanged directions with ease off both wings, maintaining excellent depth as she imposed significant pressure on Swiatek.While the American broke serve first and she played brilliantly in the early stages of the match, Swiatek elevated her level in the decisive moments without hesitation. After playing a brilliant return game at 4-5, Swiatek rolled through the tie-break playing clean, fearless attacking tennis until the end. Swiatek�s draw does not get any easier. She will now face Danielle Collins, who dismantled her to reach the final here in 2022. Despite a difficult 2023 for Collins, she perfectly fits the profile of flat-hitting, relentless ball-strikers who tend to be most successful against the Pole.For Rybakina, the challenge of facing a former No 1 player only meant that she would have to be extremely sharp. After losing her opening service game, Rybakina served well and played an extremely solid match.
Sarina Wiegman has signed a contract extension as England head coach until 2027 with the Football Association agreeing a salary increase that will make her the best paid women�s coach in the world at the moment.Wiegman, who won Euro 2022 with England and will now lead the team at the 2027 World Cup, has been given a pay rise that reflects her standing as �the No 1 coach in the world�, according to the FA chief executive, Mark Bullingham, and it is understood it is similar to the amount Emma Hayes will be paid when she starts as the new USA women�s coach in the summer.US Soccer announced in November that Hayes will become the �highest paid female coach in world football� when she takes over as head coach of the USA women�s national team at the end of the Women�s Super League season. It is understood that Hayes�s salary will be ?1.3m a year, in line with the USA men�s national team head coach, Gregg Berhalter.On Tuesday, as Wiegman�s new deal was announced, Bullingham said: �You won�t be surprised to hear that I won�t give you an amount, actually for anyone other than those we have to report. What I would say is that we see Sarina as the No 1 coach in the world in the women�s game and we think that she�s paid accordingly. I don�t know what other people in other federations are paid, but I can say I think she�s paid accordingly.�Asked whether she was feeling valued, Wiegman said: �Absolutely.�Bullingham said Wiegman staying on is �fantastic news� for the FA. �She is, in our mind, the best international coach in the women�s game, we are delighted that she�ll be with us for that next cycle of two tournaments. We�re also delighted that Arjan [Veurink, Wiegman�s assistant manager] has renewed as well. So it�s great to have them continuing with us.�
Shell�s board faces a shareholder rebellion as large investors including the UK�s biggest pension scheme prepare to back a climate activist resolution.Twenty-seven investors have agreed to back a resolution filed by the Dutch shareholder activists at Follow This that calls for the oil company to align its medium-term emissions reduction targets with the 2015 Paris agreement.The investor coalition together owns about 5% of Shell�s shares and includes the government-backed National Employment Savings Trust (Nest), which manages the pensions of almost a quarter of the UK�s workers.The resolution has also won the backing of the French asset management firm Amundi, which holds almost �2tn (?1.7tn) in assets, as well as Candriam, Scottish Widows, and Rathbones Group.Diandra Soobiah, the head of responsible investment at Nest, said: �We urge Shell to set a credible scope 3 absolute emissions target. This would demonstrate leadership, show Shell is serious about transitioning its business, and play a role in generating real world change.��Scope 3� emissions include all greenhouse gas emissions that companies do not either generate directly or purchase for their own energy needs. This extends to everything from raw materials used to create a product to the transportation that delivers that product to a consumer.Shareholders will be asked to vote on the resolution at the ?160bn company�s annual general meeting in May. The resolution has already received the backing of investors who together hold about �4tn in assets under management, and support is expected to grow over the months before Shell�s annual general meeting, according to Mark van Baal, the founder of Follow This.
Aid agencies have begun suspending vital operations in Yemen after the recent US and UK strikes on Houthi targets, amid warnings that further military intervention risks deepening one of the world�s worst humanitarian crises.A coalition of 23 aid organisations operating within the Gulf state issued a joint statement on Tuesday, warning that military escalation will further compromise their ability to deliver critical services while worsening living conditions for millions of people in Yemen.Tuesday�s statement, released shortly after reports that another cargo ship had been struck by a missile off the coast of Yemen, read: �Following the US/UK strikes, some humanitarian organisations have been forced to suspend operations over safety and security concerns, while others assess their ability to operate.�Their intervention came days after airstrikes on targets inside Yemen by the US and UK after attacks by the Iran-backed Houthi militia group on ships passing through the Red Sea. The Houthis said those attacks were an effort to put pressure on Israel to allow more humanitarian aid into Gaza and that an Israeli ceasefire would immediately lead to the free flow of ships.The strikes have prompted widespread alarm across an impoverished country already reeling from what the UN describes as one of the world�s worst humanitarian catastrophes. About 21 million Yemenis � two-thirds of the population � rely on aid to survive.Save the Children, one of the largest aid groups in Yemen with 700 staff, said it was among those currently assessing its operations. Shannon Orcutt, the organisation�s Yemen spokesperson, told the Guardian: �Several of our major partners have already paused [services] because they�re worried about staff safety and security.The statement, which Save the Children signed alongside the Norwegian Refugee Council, Saferworld and Relief International among others, urged the UK and US, along with the Houthis, to prioritise diplomacy �over military options�.It added: �Civilians and civilian infrastructure must be protected, and safe, and unhindered delivery of humanitarian assistance must be guaranteed. Within the wider regional context, we also reiterate the call for an immediate and sustained ceasefire in Gaza to save lives and avert further instability across the region.�
When Lara Ricote watches fellow comedians� gigs, she likes to be near the stage. �I tend to sit in the front row � reading lips is a big one for me,� says Ricote, who has degenerative hearing loss and wears hearing aids. �I went to see a show this week,� she continues, �and the comic chose not to use a mic. So there was 30�40% of it that I didn�t hear.�A year ago, Ricote did a live-captioned performance at Soho theatre in London. A stenographer in the room translated her jokes on to an onstage screen, in real time. �You�re like: woah, this is possible, to this extent?� Ricote remembers. �It makes you feel like you have the same access as everybody else.�That stenographer was Claire Hill who captioned her first comedy performance in 2008. Since lockdown, �it�s taken off�, says Hill who trained as a court stenographer about 30 years ago. Live captioning in comedy used to be driven by venues but now, more production companies are taking the initiative. Hill has recently been on the road with Little Wander, the company behind Aberystwyth and Machynlleth comedy festivals, captioning performances on Bridget Christie and James Acaster�s tours.
New York-based guitarist and composer Mary Halvorson doesn�t have time to hang about. When we speak she�s about to run out the door for a Saturday evening gig at John Zorn�s venue the Stone � and when that�s done she has to be up at 5am for a flight to Chicago for another show. The improvising jazz musician wouldn�t have it any other way. �Going through that period of Covid, I�m feeling very grateful that we are able to play music again and do shows,� she says from her home in Brooklyn. �It�s so gruelling, the travel that we do. We�re in a different city every day, and it�s exhausting. But I don�t even want to complain about it; I�m just grateful to be able to do it. It beats sitting in an office.�Since bursting on to the creative music scene in 2002, Halvorson has proved one of the most thrilling guitar players of her generation. She�s played with the likes of Anthony Braxton, Ornette Coleman�s bassist Jamaaladeen Tacuma, Tom Waits�s guitarist Marc Ribot and members of Deerhoof and Xiu Xiu. She�s steeped in the jazz guitar tradition yet also versed in the disruptive nature of punk, no wave and noise music.Her own oeuvre is equally uncontainable. Meltframe, her 2015 solo album of standards, warped the likes of Duke Ellington and Ornette Coleman into weird new shapes. Whether she�s playing in jazz ensembles, indie bands or noise improv, her tone is clean and crystalline, but liable to combust. With her latest, Cloudward, her writing reveals a newfound sense of beauty and clarity. �It signifies this period of optimism and moving forward,� she says. �But it�s also literal, like hey, we�re flying and travelling places again.� Tomeka Reid, cellist and longtime collaborator with Halvorson, says: �I feel like her personality really comes through on Cloudward � her sensitivity, generosity, care and her subtle humour.�Halvorson started playing violin in second grade, but on hearing Jimi Hendrix for the first time she switched to guitar. She intended to study biology at Wesleyan University, but her muse kept beckoning to her. Thanks in part to two professors there, Anthony Braxton and experimental jazz guitarist Joe Morris, her focus reverted back to the guitar. �With both Joe and with Anthony, there was a lot of emphasis on exploring, taking risks, and finding your own voice,� she told one interviewer.
In early November, I was standing in a long line at the Van Gogh gift shop in Amsterdam waiting to purchase a Pok�mon ballpoint pen. It was one of the few remaining items left in the store � this was the second month of the establishment�s Pok�mon collaboration, but the clamour for the limited edition merchandise was ceaseless. Everything from T-shirts to notebooks to shoulder bags with an image of Pikachu on the front had been picked bare, leaving only prints and postcards behind the till. It was barely past midday but the number of people crammed into the shop meant the area was soon cordoned off with others now rejected entry until it calmed down.This had become an all too familiar sight for attendees and staff. From the very start of the collaboration, which began in September for the museum�s 50th anniversary and was intended to introduce new audiences to the work of the Dutch artist, the Pok�mon merch caused mayhem as eager fans � and scalpers � clamoured for the best stuff. But the main cause was a single item: a limited edition �Pikachu With Grey Felt Hat� trading card. As soon as the card was made available, it sold out online, while desperate gallery visitors had to enter scrums to try and pick one up. Footage of the Pok� riots soon hit Twitter (now known as X), and later, eBay listings had the card on sale for up to $900. In mid-October, the card was discontinued.So what was it like to actually work there? �The first week was quite awful,� one employee recalls. �It was just way too busy. Lots of people trying to come in four times a day just trying to get the card.� Intended for kids aged six to 12, the card was awarded on completion of a Pok�mon treasure hunt that involved learning about the history of the painter from a set of new Van Gogh-inspired Pok�mon paintings, which have been temporarily added to the exhibition.�In the morning, people were just running straight to the store even though it was only one item per person,� the same employee says. They describe the scene as being more like a �theme park� than a museum with at least 2,000 out of 5,500 sold tickets there for the card alone. A lot of people who showed up on the day needed to be turned away.
al is a staple in homes across India, and the country now consumes more than 23m metric tonnes of pulses every year � with such a large vegetarian population, dal provides much of the protein in our everyday diet. For me, every simple yet comforting bowlful spells home cooking.Langarwali dal � or creamy dal cooked with ginger, chilli and turmeric. This comforting dish is served at many gurudwaras, Sikh places of worship, where fresh meals are prepared daily in the langar, or communal kitchen, for everyone who wishes to eat. This recipe uses black split urad dal, also known as urad dal chilka, which takes on a rich, creamy consistency when cooked. I use kashmiri chilli powder for its mild heat and vibrant colour, but you can swap it for mild paprika, if you prefer. The tadka, or tempering, at the end gives this humble dal lots more flavour.Prep 10 min Soak 30 min Cook 1 hr 40 min Serves 4 280g black split urad dal 2 tbsp ghee A pinch of asafoetida 5cm piece ginger, peeled and finely chopped 1 green bird�s eye chilli, slit lenthways 150g tomatoes, roughly chopped 2 tsp turmeric powder ? tsp kashmiri chilli powder Salt, to taste 1 tsp garam masala A pinch of sugar Coriander, to garnishFor the tadka 1 tbsp ghee 1 tsp cumin seeds 2 dried mild red chilliesSoak the dal in cold water for 30 minutes, then drain. Put the dal and a litre and a half of fresh water in a large saucepan, bring to a simmer on a medium heat and cook for an hour and 20 minutes, stirring occasionally to make sure it doesn�t stick to the bottom of the pan. Once cooked, mash the soft dal slightly and set aside.Put the ghee in a large nonstick saucepan on a medium heat, add the asafoetida and fry for a few seconds. Stir in the ginger, add the chilli and fry for a minute. Add the tomatoes and cook for four minutes, until they soften and turn mushy. Add the turmeric and chilli powder, fry for a minute, then add the cooked dal, season with salt to taste and simmer, stirring occasionally, for three minutes. Add 200ml water, to loosen the mix, then cover and simmer on a low heat for three to four minutes. Add the garam masala and sugar, garnish with coriander and turn off the heat.Put the ghee for the tadka in a small pan on a medium heat, then add the cumin and chillies, and fry for a minute. Pour the flavoured oil over the dal, stir and cover the pot so the flavours infuse. Serve warm with rotis.
The date was 12 March 2023. My body was shaking all over. My life flashed before my eyes: the incessant binge-drinking sessions, countless blackouts, urinating all over myself, gorging on cheesy chips and Domino�s Pizza in the early hours of the morning, jobs given up after just a few weeks. A life of total fecklessness.I wasn�t having a panic attack. I was simply having a conversation with the man who inspired me to turn my life around: Elton John. We were at his annual Aids Foundation Oscars party in Hollywood, and I finally had the chance to thank him in person for helping me in my journey to sobriety after years addicted to alcohol. We spoke about recovery, and I told him that the way he overcame his own problems had provided me with the blueprint that would save my life. He may have been wearing a pair of bright red heart-shaped sunglasses at the time, but he was extremely down-to-earth and gracious.It had all started at the University of Bristol in 2009. I had a nascent drinking problem, but I was only 18. At that stage it was all just harmless fun. I was a student making friends at uni. I met my then girlfriend (now wife), Deborah. Someone down the corridor bought the DVD of Elton�s 60th birthday concert at Madison Square Garden. I was gobsmacked and fell in love with his live show. It wasn�t just Elton himself who I began to idolise, but also his longtime band members, drummer Nigel Olsson and guitarist Davey Johnstone.Fast forward to 2014, and by then I had a full-on alcohol problem. I quit my first proper job as a trainee accountant after just six weeks. My life was in total disarray and I struggled to even pay the rent. The only glimmer of hope was a ?6,000 government start-up loan I secured to launch a clothing brand. It was extremely difficult to get off the ground, but a speculative email led to a reply directly from Olsson. He accepted my offer to become a brand ambassador for Tom Cridland Clothing and, as a result, the business took off
With pop-culture brand recognition like no other auteur, he walks the walk and talks the talk � in that inimitable voice. Werner Herzog � film-maker, visionary, adventurer and first among equals of the New German cinema � is now the subject of a highly enjoyable new documentary from Thomas von Steinaecker, who has assembled an A-list gallery of interviewees to talk about knowing or working with the great man; these include Wim Wenders, Volker Schl�ndorff, Nicole Kidman, Chlo� Zhao, Joshua Oppenheimer, Robert Pattinson and many more.The release of this film happens to coincide with Herzog�s autobiography Every Man for Himself and God Against All (which is also the original German title of his film The Enigma of Kasper Hauser) and I was a little disappointed that Radical Dreamer does not include Herzog�s recollection of a childhood knife-fight with his brother over ownership of the family hamster. (Though it does show us his outdoor TV interview with Mark Kermode, in the course of which Herzog was shot by a distant obsessive fan/enemy/critic with an air-rifle. Herzog later merely pulled down the waistband of his boxers to reveal the seeping wound and said with a shrug that he didn�t want to go to hospital.)The film takes us through his early successes such as Even Dwarfs Started Small, then the folie de grandeur masterpieces such as Aguirre Wrath of God and Fitzcarraldo, which both starred his tumultuous alter ego Klaus Kinski, and then through to his later documentary work, including the remarkable Grizzly Man. Zhao says all of his films are about the same thing and same person: himself, of course, the lone dissident, the liminal risk-taker, the existential disruptor testing the boundaries of sanity and possibility, whether it�s Fitzcarraldo or the penguin in his nature study Encounters at the End of the World who leaves all the other penguins and troops determinedly off into the freezing interior.Well, maybe. There�s something almost Wellesian or Hitchcockian in the way Herzog uses celebrity to keep getting pictures made, and his work rate is one of the marvellous things about him. Calling a film-maker a �dreamer� sounds hackneyed, but it does justice to his idealism. Perhaps no other description will do.
A prize-winning Bosnian and Serbian novelist has cut ties with her German publisher in protest against what she describes as its silence on the humanitarian crisis in Gaza, as a call for an all-out boycott of German cultural institutions over the government�s pro-Israel stance divides opinion.Lana Basta�i�, 37, who won the 2020 EU prize for literature for her debut novel, Catch the Rabbit, posted on Instagram on Monday that it had been her �moral and ethical duty to terminate my contracts� with the publishing house S Fischer, citing its failure �to be vocal about the ongoing genocide happening in Gaza�, as well as the �censorship� of pro-Palestinian voices in Germany.Founded in 1886 by the Jewish publicist Samuel von Fischer, Frankfurt-S. Fischer Verlag was driven into exile by the Nazi regime in 1936. On its website, the publishing house states its intention to �stand up to new forms of antisemitic and racist thinking and action [�] especially after Hamas� massacre on 7 October 2023�.A spokesperson for S Fischer confirmed that Basta�i� had terminated her contract in December, adding: �We respect her decision and are in constructive talks with her agency.�In an email to the Guardian, Basta�i� said the contract she had terminated was for her next novel, which is still in the process of being written. �I walked away from enough money to last me a year,� she said.Germany�s government has been one of Israel�s most vocal allies since the recent escalation of the conflict in the Middle East. On Friday, it said the accusation of genocide against Israel at international court of justice was completely unfounded and amounted to a �political instrumentalisation� of the UN genocide convention.
The eternally yoked-together blockbusters Barbie and Oppenheimer have cleaned up at the Critics Choice awards, suggesting the momentum is with both films as the Academy awards loom. Together the films won a total of 14 awards � with Oppenheimer edging their personal competition by 8 to 6.Oppenheimer dominated the headline awards, winning best picture, best director for Christopher Nolan and best acting ensemble, with Robert Downey Jr also picking up best supporting actor for his role as Atomic Energy Commission member Lewis Strauss. The film also won a number of craft awards, including best cinematography, editing and visual effects.Though losing out to Oppenheimer for the best picture award, Barbie racked up a string of wins, including best comedy, best original screenplay and best song for I�m Just Ken.The lead acting awards, however, produced something of a surprise, with Paul Giamatti defeating Oppenheimer�s Cillian Murphy for The Holdovers, and Poor Things� Emma Stone beating Killers of the Flower Moon�s Lily Gladstone. Unlike the Golden Globes, where all four actors won in separate categories for drama and comedy/musical, the Critics Choice operates as a head-to-head, suggesting Giamatti and Stone may have edged ahead in the race for the Oscars.In the television section, the awards largely paralleled the Golden Globes, with Beef (four wins), The Bear (four) and Succession (three) picking up most. Succession�s Kieran Culkin and Sarah Snook replicated their Globes awards best actor and actress, as did The Bear�s Jeremy Allen White and Ayo Edebiri, and Beef�s Steven Yeun and Ali Wong.The awards are presented by the Critics Choice Association, the largest such group in the US and Canada, and the ceremony was hosted by Chelsea Handler.
You don�t need to be a film buff to know John Williams� music. He has scored a staggering array of Hollywood hits, from the Star Wars franchise to Harry Potter, via Schindler�s List, ET and Lincoln. Now almost 92, he�s been nominated for more Academy awards than anyone except Walt Disney.Williams� other compositions are a different matter. Despite featuring at Barack Obama�s inauguration and various Olympic ceremonies, his numerous concert works are rarely heard in the UK.No surprise, then, that the Royal Festival Hall was stuffed for this mostly Williams programme from the London Philharmonic Orchestra. As Jonathon Heyward launched into the opening fanfare of Williams� Superman March � his debut with the orchestra; what a beginning � audience members around the stage visibly leaned in. This was the Williams we know and love, poised and precise as the theme motors along, the lyrical moments positively melt-in-the-mouth.There were traces of that composer in the UK premiere of his Violin Concerto No 2: in the placement of a flute solo, the shape of a horn interjection, the froth of cymbal at a phrase�s peak. But we weren�t in Hollywood any more. Many passages involved sustained bass pedals or circling patterns over which an atonal descant was dropped. The third movement developed from spiky, angular jabs from the soloist into a kind of lopsided dance. Frequent cadenzas riffed on cliches of showy violin technique � double-stopping, arpeggiation, ferociously rapid passagework. Played by violinist extraordinaire Anne-Sophie Mutter (for whom it was written), the concerto was compelling enough � but with her astonishing technical control and absolute musical drive, Mutter could, I suspect, make pretty much anything sound irresistible.
Translated poetry seldom finds a home in this column � if only because when youhave no knowledge of the original language, the reading can be like trying to see through frosted glass. But the Ukrainian poet Iryna Shuvalova is a revelation. This is her fifth collection, her first to be translated into English, and it is extraordinary to read partly because, even though these poems were written before the war (touching on the 2014 Russian invasion of Crimea), they offer insight into what it is to be Ukrainian at this catastrophic moment in her country�s history. She was born in Kyiv, is a fine linguist herself (a translator of Ted Hughes into Ukrainian) and has collaborated on the translation of her own work with the American poet Olena Jennings. She has completed a PhD at Cambridge about communities affected by the war in Ukraine�s east.pray to the empty wells is a heart-stirring, gallant and prescient collection that reminds you of the otherness of poetry, its territorial freedoms and viewless wings (what cannot be seen � only imagined � is critical). It is dominated by the spirit to survive, to embrace nature and to pray. The tremendous Ukrainian-Jewish-American poet Ilya Kaminsky hails Shuvalova as someone who �builds a country of dreams in order to survive in one of real drama�. He sees young, optimistic Ukrainian poets as among the most energetic working in Europe.
Panto season is just about over and we�ve booed the baddies to our hearts� content. But as the curtain falls on this distinctive sound until next Christmas, should we consider jeering more often? This is not a call for more of the antisocial chomping, swiping, swilling, peeing or worse that have made the headlines recently. It is an inquiry into the old � and possibly fine � tradition of collective dissent, expressed in the once almighty audience �boo�.In pantomime, such protests have little sting � they are so infused with obliging bonhomie that we may as well be clapping. The more straight-faced, incendiary boo of displeasure has been all but silenced, bar lone tuts or harrumphs. But for centuries, theatregoing etiquette allowed for heckles and hisses alongside cheers and whistles, all permissible within the great debating chamber of drama.Booing is still present in the realms of standup, music concerts, opera, even the Cannes film festival � and it feels fairly shocking when it occurs. This might be because the material is deemed scrappy, or the action on stage offensive. But boos can also be a sign of intolerance. Robert Hastie, artistic director of Sheffield Theatres, has seen it in opera. �It�s usually because the performer or performance has deigned to present an alternative to an established, canonical interpretation. I know an actor [of colour] who worked in Germany, in a Wagner opera, who was booed.�From ancient Greece onwards, a powerful exchange between performer and spectator has been a cornerstone of the theatre experience. Pamela Jikiemi, head of film, TV and audio at Rada, notes that when plays were the main form of entertainment, they were often so long that social interaction became inevitable: �Audiences were encouraged to respond.�
Joyce Randolph, a veteran stage and television actor whose role as the savvy Trixie Norton on The Honeymooners provided the perfect foil to her dimwitted TV husband, has died. She was 99.Randolph died of natural causes Saturday night at her home on the Upper West Side of Manhattan, her son Randolph Charles told the Associated Press on Sunday.She was the last surviving main character of the beloved comedy from television�s golden age of the 1950s.�The Honeymooners� was an affectionate look at Brooklyn tenement life, based in part on star Jackie Gleason�s childhood. Gleason played the blustering bus driver Ralph Kramden. Audrey Meadows was his wisecracking, strong-willed wife Alice, and Art Carney the cheerful sewer worker Ed Norton. Alice and Trixie often found themselves commiserating over their husbands� various follies and mishaps, whether unknowingly marketing dogfood as a popular snack or trying in vain to resist a rent hike, or freezing in the winter as their heat is shut off.Randolph would later cite a handful of favorite episodes, including one in which Ed is sleepwalking.�And Carney calls out, �Thelma?!� He never knew his wife�s real name,� she later told the Television Academy Foundation.Originating in 1950 as a recurring skit on Gleason�s variety show, Cavalcade of Stars, The Honeymooners still ranks among the all-time favorites of television comedy. The show grew in popularity after Gleason switched networks with The Jackie Gleason Show. Later, for one season in 1955-56, it became a full-fledged series.Those 39 episodes became a staple of syndicated programming aired all over the country and beyond.
When he was the House of Commons speaker, John Bercow developed a combative reputation � and after his tenure he was found to be a �serial bully� and a liar. But now as he makes his reality TV debut, the man with the famous cry of �order!� is seeking to use his political experience to unleash chaos.�I�m a retired politician,� Bercow said in the season premiere of the US version of The Traitors. �Backstabbing, deception are all part and parcel of the political life.�Bercow joins the Love Island winner Ekin-Su C�lc�lo?lu, Tamra Judge of The Real Housewives of Orange County, Maksim Chmerkovskiy of Dancing with the Stars and Marcus Jordan � son of the basketball legend Michael Jordan � as one of 21 celebrities competing at a castle in the Scottish Highlands for a cash prize � the same venue as the UK version, broadcast by BBC. Three of the contestants have been chosen by the host, Alan Cumming, to sow chaos and purposely sabotage the others.While Bercow was not selected as a traitor, several of his fellow contestants suspected he was after he experienced �breathing difficulties� during the premiere. He blamed the difficulties on asthma, but others doubted his answer.
Agroup of misfit circus performers, led by bewhiskered father figure Israel (Giorgio Tirabassi), tour the backwaters of early 1940s Italy. But the troupe falls foul of the occupying Nazi forces � Israel for his Jewish heritage, the others due to their powers (to label them superpowers rather overstates the usefulness of these unique but niche skills). Cencio (Pietro Castellitto) has the ability to wrangle insects. Part-man, part-shagpile carpet Fulvio (Claudio Santamaria) possesses unusual strength. Grinning simpleton Mario (Giancarlo Martini) can stick cutlery to his forehead. Most impressive is teenager Matilde (Aurora Giovinazzo), whose body is charged with electricity.Throw in an underground amputee resistance movement and a crazed German circus ringmaster with two extra fingers and the gift of premonition (Franz Rogowski, on enjoyably deranged form) and you have this lurid, extravagantly violent Italian action fantasy directed by Gabriele Mainetti. Like a Del Toro-esque carnival of the macabre filtered through the greasy lens of a VHS bargain bin exploitation B-movie, it�s so far over the top, it might as well have been filmed from space. A mess, but enjoyable nonetheless.
Marika Hackman wrote Big Sigh during a tough spell. Trapped in her own thoughts over lockdown, the Hampshire-born singer-songwriter forced her way through creative deadlock until she had a breakthrough that resulted in her first album of original material since 2019�s acclaimed Any Human Friend. But where its predecessor was louche and hook-driven, this fourth studio album skulks deeper into her psyche, its occasional moments of catharsis upended by sombre piano interludes and bleak lyricism.Hackman�s unease makes itself felt from the bitter little chuckle that opens The Lonely House to the half-despairing pep talks she feeds herself in No Caffeine: �Scream into a bag, try to turn your brain off,� she murmurs over a pummelling bassline. Coping mechanisms are ditched in breakup ballad Hanging, in which she feels �pushed underwater� by grief. On the deadpan Vitamins, she dismisses her own body as �a sack of shit and oxygen�.Bodies are a recurring theme for Hackman, who can find horror-movie material in the everyday. But this preoccupation with blood and guts also extends to desire, breaking her out of her own head and back into the world: on the blistering Slime, she longs to �climb your spine and shake your mind, slide back and feel your bones crack�.
n the infinite high desert of Utah, a poignantly moving scene unfolds: 14-year-old Mark is in his sleeping bag, into which a soulmate he has found, and loves, creeps with stealth. This is not some idyllic hiking holiday, it is an extended boot camp � at once punitive and supposedly curative � to which Mark and the girl � Lainey, aged 17, with scarred wrists � have been dispatched by their parents, for behaviour considered beyond control; in Mark�s case striking a friend, then his mother. But this is a stolen moment of redemptive, subversive young love. �Until I met Lainey, I didn�t know that talking was another form of breathing,� Mark reflects.But the moment is then cruelly shattered by a sudden flashback: Mark recognises the same skin condition as that of his uncle, and the instant is ambushed by something he had kept �far back in the dark� of his own mind. In a destructive � and self-destructive � consternation, he pushes Lainey away, and with her their mutual feelings for each other.Jonathan Wells is an acclaimed American poet, and was hosted for the UK presentation of this first novel among the vinyl racks at Rough Trade records in Ladbroke Grove, west London, beneath posters for the Sex Pistols and the Clash on one wall, New York�s Television and Patti Smith on another. Why? Because although The Sterns� is a tight and taut family drama, it unfolds against a backdrop of rock�n�roll generally, and mid-1970s American punk specifically, to which Wells devoted much of his youth at the famous CBGB club � as did, in the book, Mark�s uncle Spence and father, Benjamin.And while the heart of this story is dark, there is a wondrously comic subplot. Toxic Spence � or rather Wells � comes up with an inspired idea, about rock, roll and ageing. Spence is in the hearing aid business, vexed at how elderly people resist his products as a sign of surrender to time, �no longer a player in the external world�. His plan is to buy the brand franchise of the now closed CBGB, and market a line of unapologetically decorative hearing aids called the Rocker, on the marvellous premise that: �Wouldn�t that transform us from being hobbling, ageing men into esteemed veterans, into actors in a great drama [having made] a sacrifice for rock and roll?�
One era�s foul-mouthed insult is another�s evocatively named topological feature, which is why, if you find yourself driving past a clefted hill in rural Lincolnshire, you might be delighted to know that it was once referred to as �Cuntewellewang�, not that far from �Scamcunt Grene�.I gleaned these and many other utterly diverting facts from Jenni Nuttall�s Mother Tongue: The Surprising History of Women�s Words, in which she minutely details the shifts of language and meaning over the centuries through the lens of women�s experiences.Who knew that medieval anatomists once used the term �stones� to mean both testicles and ovaries? That, for many centuries, �girl� was a gender-neutral term? That, in words equally applicable to men and women, where now we may describe sex as �fucking�, once we might also have said �swiving� or �sarding�?Nuttall, an academic specialising in medieval literature, was partly inspired to write Mother Tongue by the process of trying to find adequate and accurate ways to explain the world � and women�s place in it � to her growing daughter; acknowledging the complexity of the past, she found, helped to make sense of the present.
The creator of The Sopranos has decried what he views as the death of quality TV, blaming risk-averse executives and distracted audiences.David Chase, who wrote the HBO series about the New Jersey mafia that many credit with starting a golden age of television, said that era was now over.The 78-year-old said he was being told to �dumb down� his productions, and had been warned against making television that �requires an audience to focus�.Talking to the Times 25 years after The Sopranos first aired, Chase said the last quarter-century of ambitious and complex drama was �a blip�.He said he now viewed it as: �A 25-year blip. And to be clear, I�m not talking only about The Sopranos, but a lot of other hugely talented people out there who I feel increasingly bad for.�He added: �This is the 25th anniversary, so of course it�s a celebration. But perhaps we shouldn�t look at it like that. Maybe we should look at it like a funeral.�He believes the type of show that was synonymous with The Sopranos � such as The Wire, Breaking Bad and Mad Men � would not be commissioned now.�We�re going back to where I was,� said Chase. �They�re going to have commercials � and I�ve already been told to dumb it down.�
Gerald Murnane�s novels are so strange, so far from literature�s beaten path, that their very existence � let alone their republication and celebration � seems miraculous. And they are celebrated: the 84-year-old Australian author is a regular favourite for the Nobel prize in literature, and this month sees the reissue of his fourth novel, Inland, first published in 1988 and in the view of JM Coetzee, Murnane�s �most ambitious, sustained and powerful piece of writing�.After his early novels, Tamarisk Row (1974) and A Lifetime on Clouds (1976) � idiosyncratic but broadly autobiographical stories of growing up � Murnane published The Plains (1982), a transitional work blending fiction with a philosophical style. Inland followed: his first mature work in the sense that it is recognisably from the same pen and the same mind as all his later fiction.It is traditional in a book review to summarise or at least introduce the plot, but here there is no plot to speak of. There is, however, narrative direction, and an intimacy that comes from the narrator directly addressing the reader, both of which give Inland a surprisingly moreish quality. �It is easier for you than for me, reader. While you read you are sure of coming to the end of the pages. But while I write I cannot be sure of coming to the end.�It reads like nonfiction, but the narrator is not Murnane. We know this because he opens the book by saying: �I am writing in the library of a manor-house, in a village I prefer not to name, near the town of Kunmadaras, in Szolnok County.� This places us in Hungary, and Murnane, we know � one of many eccentric trivialities that circle him � has never left Australia.
India�s solar observation mission has entered the sun�s orbit after a four-month journey, the latest success for the space exploration ambitions of the world�s most populous country.The Aditya-L1 mission was launched in September and is carrying an array of instruments to measure and observe the sun�s outermost layers.India�s science and technology minister, Jitendra Singh, said on social media that the probe had reached its final orbit �to discover the mysteries of sun-Earth connection�.The US and the European Space Agency have sent numerous probes to the centre of the solar system, beginning with Nasa�s Pioneer programme in the 1960s. Japan and China have also launched their own solar observatory missions into Earth�s orbit.But the latest mission by the Indian Space Research Organisation is the first by any country in Asia to be placed in orbit around the sun.India�s prime minister, Narendra Modi, hailed it as another landmark in the country�s space programme. �It is a testament to the relentless dedication of our scientists,� he said on social media. �We will continue to pursue new frontiers of science for the benefit of humanity.�Aditya, named after a Hindu sun deity, has travelled 932,000 miles (1.5m km) from Earth � still only 1% of the distance between Earth and the sun. It is now at a point where the gravitational forces of both celestial bodies cancel out, allowing it to remain in a stable halo orbit around the sun.
Ancient DNA helps explain why northern Europeans have a higher risk of multiple sclerosis than other ancestries: the disease is a genetic legacy of horseback-riding cattle herders who swept into the region about 5,000 years ago.The findings come from a huge project to compare modern DNA with that culled from ancient humans� teeth and bones � allowing scientists to trace prehistoric migration and disease-linked genes that tagged along.When a bronze age people called the Yamnaya moved from the steppes of what are now Ukraine and Russia into north-western Europe, they carried gene variants that today are known to increase people�s risk of multiple sclerosis, researchers reported on Wednesday.Yet the Yamnaya flourished, widely spreading those variants. Those genes probably also protected the nomadic herders from infections carried by their cattle and sheep, concluded the research published in the journal Nature.�What we found surprised everyone,� said the study�s co-author William Barrie, a genetics researcher at the University of Cambridge. �These variants were giving these people an advantage of some kind.�It�s one of several findings from a first-of-its-kind gene bank with thousands of samples from early humans in Europe and western Asia, a project headed by Eske Willerslev of Cambridge and the University of Copenhagen who helped pioneer the study of ancient DNA. Similar research has traced even earlier cousins of humans such as Neanderthals.Using the new gene bank to explore MS was a logical first step. That�s because, while MS can strike any population, it is most common among white descendants of northern Europeans and scientists have been unable to explain why.
Archaeologists have uncovered a cluster of lost cities in the Amazon rainforest that was home to at least 10,000 farmers about 2,000 years ago.A series of earthen mounds and buried roads in Ecuador was first noticed more than two decades ago by archaeologist St�phen Rostain. But at the time, �I wasn�t sure how it all fit together,� said Rostain, one of the researchers who reported on the finding in the journal Science on Thursday.Recent mapping by laser-sensor technology revealed those sites to be part of a dense network of settlements and connecting roadways, tucked into the forested foothills of the Andes, that lasted about 1,000 years.�It was a lost valley of cities,� said Rostain, who directs investigations at France�s National Center for Scientific Research. �It�s incredible.�The settlements were occupied by the Upano people between about 500BC and AD300 to 600 � a period roughly contemporaneous with the Roman empire in Europe, the researchers found.Residential and ceremonial buildings erected on more than 6,000 earthen mounds were surrounded by agricultural fields with drainage canals. The largest roads were 33 feet (10 meters) wide and stretched for 6-12 miles (10-20km).While it is difficult to estimate populations, the site was home to at least 10,000 inhabitants � and perhaps as many as 15,000 or 30,000 at its peak, said archaeologist Antoine Dorison, a study co-author at the same French institute. That is comparable to the estimated population of Roman-era London, then Britain�s largest city.
Scientists have developed a simple test that can identify 18 early-stage cancers that experts say could represent a medical �gamechanger�.Cancer accounts for one in every six deaths worldwide, but early detection can significantly improve outcomes. Existing screening tests have drawbacks, including invasiveness, cost and low levels of accuracy for early stage disease.Now US researchers have designed a test that analyses proteins in the blood and can pick up 18 early stage cancers, representing all main organs in the human body.Specific blood proteins could already be used for early detection and monitoring, but until now tests have lacked sensitivity � accuracy of picking up those with cancer � and specificity � accuracy of excluding those without cancer, the researchers said.The team, from the US biotech firm Novelna, said their test outperformed others relying on tumour DNA in the blood, and had �a sensitivity much greater� than the Galleri test being trialled on the NHS in the UK.By looking at proteins in blood plasma, the experts were able to differentiate cancer samples from normal ones, and even distinguish between different types of cancers �with high accuracy�, they said. The research also found evidence that cancer protein signals were likely to be sex-specific.Writing in the journal BMJ Oncology, the team said: �This finding is the foundation for a multi-cancer screening test for the early detection of 18 solid tumours that cover all major human organs of origin for such cancers at the earliest stage of their development with high accuracy.�
Rocket and satellite maker SpaceX on Thursday sued a US labor board to block its case accusing the company of illegally firing employees who sent a letter to company executives calling its CEO, Elon Musk, �a distraction and embarrassment�.In a lawsuit filed in Brownsville, Texas, federal court, SpaceX claims the structure of the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) � which issued a complaint against the company on Wednesday � violates the US constitution.The NLRB alleges that SpaceX violated federal labor law by firing eight workers in 2022 for signing on to the letter, which accused Musk of making sexist comments that went against company policies. That case will be heard by an administrative judge and then a five-member board appointed by the US president. The board�s decisions can be appealed in federal court.SpaceX in its lawsuit claims that, because federal law only allows board members and administrative judges to be removed for cause, and not at will, the NLRB�s structure is unconstitutional. The lawsuit seeks to block the NLRB case from moving forward.An NLRB spokesperson declined to comment.SpaceX recently utilized a similar tactic to block an administrative case by the US Department of Justice claiming the company illegally refused to hire refugees and asylum recipients.A federal judge in Brownsville paused the administrative case in November, pending the outcome of a lawsuit by SpaceX. The judge said the US constitution required that administrative judges at the justice department be appointed by the president, and not the attorney general, as they currently are.The NLRB is already facing a similar lawsuit from a Starbucks employee who opposed the unionization of the New York store where she works. The worker sued the board in October after it denied her petition for an election to dissolve the union. The agency has not responded to that lawsuit.
